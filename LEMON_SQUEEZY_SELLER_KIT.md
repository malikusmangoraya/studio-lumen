## 5. What The Buyer Sets Up After Purchase

Hand this list to the customer with the download. It is the complete key-insertion path — no code changes are required.

1. **Store identity** — `LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID`, `LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_URL` (both in `backend/.env`, plus `VITE_LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID` / `VITE_LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_URL` in `frontend/.env`).
2. **Plans** — one `LEMONSQUEEZY_VARIANT_<PLAN>` per pricing tier, or `variantId` on each plan in `PricingTable.jsx`.
3. **Webhooks** — `LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` plus an endpoint at `https://their-domain/api/lemonsqueezy/webhook` for `order_created`, `order_refunded`, `subscription_created`, `subscription_updated`, `subscription_cancelled`, `license_key_created`, `license_key_updated`.
4. **Optional** — `LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY` to create checkouts server-side instead of using the store overlay link.
5. **Other cards** — `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` / `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `PADDLE_API_KEY`, then set `PAYMENT_GATEWAYS_ENABLED` to the list you want live (`all` enables every implemented gateway while testing).
6. **Environment on the host** — with Docker, the same variables are read straight from the host `.env` (see `docker-compose.yml`), so no rebuild is needed.

Smoke test: `GET /api/lemonsqueezy/config` must report `configured: true`, and a paid order must appear as `succeeded` in the payments table.
