/**
 * Service worker registration.
 *
 * The URL and the scope are both taken from Vite's BASE_URL, because these
 * apps are served from a GitHub Pages subpath: BASE_URL is `/<repo>/` in the
 * Pages workflow. Registering `/sw.js` instead would request the apex domain,
 * where nothing answers, and the default `/` scope would claim control of every
 * repository on that Pages host rather than this one.
 *
 * Registration is skipped outside production on purpose: a cached shell during
 * development serves yesterday's bundle and makes every change look like it did
 * not apply. The worker itself clears old caches on activate, so a redeploy
 * reaches returning visitors without a manual refresh.
